recreating weight watcher app, by using the basic dataset for food convert into points and using the calculation from them.


### Techstack
I want to build an app base on the real weight watcher, because I dont have all the dataset, thats why I gonna create a prototype app that could do the same like what the real weight watcher can do. This is only for study purpose - not for sale.

#this project will not be continue, during time issue

Now I have time to continue working on this project. The thinks that I need to do is, to find a data set with food ocjects with their calories and nuetrius. Then start thinking on who to create a algorithm to calculate the ocjects into dishes and which nuetrius and calories are there. 

Maybe like this: Dish = apple pie -> indrigricend = 3 x 'apple', 90g sugar, 
- I have found a dataset for that: National Nutrient Database

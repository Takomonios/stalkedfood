recreating weight watcher app, by using the basic dataset for food convert into points and using the calculation from them.


### Techstack
I want to build an app base on the real weight watcher, because I dont have all the dataset, thats why I gonna create a prototype app that could do the same like what the real weight watcher can do. This is only for study purpose - not for sale.
